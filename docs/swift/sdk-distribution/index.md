\# SDK Distribution You can integrate the Dropbox Swift SDK into your project using one of several methods. ## Swift Package Manager The Dropbox Swift SDK can be installed in your project using \[Swift Package Manager\](https://swift.org/package-manager/) by specifying the Dropbox Swift SDK repository URL: \`\`\` https://github.com/dropbox/SwiftyDropbox.git \`\`\` Refer to \[Apple's "Adding Package Dependencies to Your App" documentation\](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding\_package\_dependencies\_to\_your\_app) for more information. ## CocoaPods To use \[CocoaPods\](http://cocoapods.org), a dependency manager for Cocoa projects, you should first install it using the following command: \`\`\`bash $ gem install cocoapods \`\`\` Then navigate to the directory that contains your project and create a new file called \`Podfile\`. You can do this either with \`pod init\`, or open an existing Podfile, and then add \`pod 'SwiftyDropbox'\` to the main loop. Your Podfile should look something like this: \`\`\`ruby use\_frameworks! target '<YOUR\_PROJECT\_NAME>' do pod 'SwiftyDropbox' end \`\`\` If your project contains Objective-C code that will need to have access to Dropbox SDK there is a separate pod called \`SwiftyDropboxObjC\` that contains an Objective-C compatibility layer for the SDK. Add this pod to your \`Podfile\` (in addition to \`SwiftyDropbox\` or on its own). For more information refer to the \[Objective-C\](../objective-c) section. Then, run the following command to install the dependency: \`\`\`bash $ pod install \`\`\` Once your project is integrated with the Dropbox Swift SDK, you can pull SDK updates using the following command: \`\`\`bash $ pod update \`\`\`
