# App Store Connect Privacy Labels

To assist developers using Dropbox SDKs in filling out Apple's Privacy Practices Questionnaire, the below information is provided on the data that may be collected and used by Dropbox.

As you complete the questionnaire you should note that the below information is general in nature. Dropbox SDKs are designed to be configured by the developer to incorporate Dropbox functionality as is best suited to their application. As a result of this customizable nature of the Dropbox SDKs, we are unable to provide information on the actual data collection and use for each application. We advise developers reference the [Dropbox for HTTP Developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation) for specifics on how data is collected by each Dropbox API.

In addition, you should note that the information below only identifies Dropbox's collection and use of data. You are responsible for identifying your own collection and use of data in your app, which may result in different questionnaire answers than identified below.
