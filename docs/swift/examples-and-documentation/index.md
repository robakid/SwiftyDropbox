## Stone

All routes and data types are auto-generated using a framework called [Stone](https://github.com/dropbox/stone).

The `stone` repo contains all of the Swift specific generation logic, and the `spec` repo contains the language-neutral API endpoint specifications which serve as input to the language-specific generators.
